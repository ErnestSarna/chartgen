"""Thin over-generated notes down to what the audio supports.

The model is near grid-saturated on real songs (~5.3 notes/sec against a
~6.35/sec ceiling) and the held-out eval measured 1.4-2x the human chart's
note count. The README's onset analysis showed why: ~41% of Expert notes sit
more than 60ms from any detected audio onset — the model fills the grid
instead of tracking the part.

This gates chart positions on onset evidence from the audio itself, which
scales with the song instead of imposing a genre prior: an EDM drop keeps its
wall of notes because every one has onset energy behind it; a breakdown thins
out because nothing does. Two safeguards keep it musical:

- strength is judged against a LOCAL rolling ceiling, so a quiet bridge is
  gated by bridge loudness, not by the drop three sections earlier;
- a note is never dropped if removing it would open a gap of more than two
  beats — sparse passages are already sparse, and silence reads as a bug.
