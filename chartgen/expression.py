(chartgen.transcribe); this module holds the expression that is derived from
the chart and the audio structure.

elsewhere and applied at WRITE time, after reduction — the vendored difficulty
reducer treats `N 6` / `N 5` lines as ordinary notes and would keep or drop
them inconsistently per tier, so they never pass through it. Natural HOPOs

    starts 44 beats apart (RBN: 40), 0.79 phrases per 40 beats (RBN: 1.0),

    slow songs and over-filled fast ones.
