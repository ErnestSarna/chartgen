    """Re-lane stuck stretches from the spectral-centroid contour.

    Validated need (95-song ownership study): in bass-dominated windows
    human charts still use a median of FOUR distinct lanes - charters
    chart the filter sweep as lane movement when pitch has nothing to
    say (a growl's wub rising and falling reads as notes climbing and
    falling; that is what the ear tracks at constant f0). Our mapping is
    strictly pitch-driven, so a monotone growl riff charted one lane -
    the exact "one note repeated or opens" playtest complaint.

    Only stretches that are BOTH stuck (<=2 lanes across 8+ beats of
    single notes) AND spectrally moving (centroid p90/p10 >= 1.6 on the
    melodic stems) are touched: a palm-muted chug is stuck but static,
    and stays; a varied line is never stuck. Lanes come from quantile-
    mapped log-centroids, median-filtered so frame jitter cannot zigzag,
    and the result must actually gain variety (>=3 lanes) or the stretch
    is left alone. Ticks, sustains and counts never change; opens inside
    a re-laned stretch become fretted (they were register artifacts of
    the octave-lift, not punctuation).

(The 800-chart genre-balanced set later measured a 6.3% median - rock/metal charts jump far more than EDM - but the clamp stays: the playtests that approved this feel are the target, and it can be relaxed per-run with --max-fret-jump.)

    Clamping the step while keeping its DIRECTION preserves pitch contour,

    four-lane leap becomes two moves of two, so the line still arrives, just
