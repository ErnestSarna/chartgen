"""Guitar-stem evidence via BS-RoFormer SW, and the chord-texture pass.

The signal that unblocked this file: htdemucs has no guitar stem and its
6-stem variant is unusable (guitar 5.2 SDR, poisons "other"), so "is a
strummed guitar playing chords here" was undecidable - Mary Jane and Faded
measured identically on every chart-level signal (33%/33% raw chords,
79%/82% same-shape runs), which killed the first chord-riff gate. BS-RoFormer
SW (guitar 9.05 SDR) separates them 33% vs 0.0% guitar-stem energy with
94-98% vs 0% active windows on the local library test (2026-08-31), at
~34-48s per song on the RTX 3060 Ti.

The chord-texture pass this enables attacks the largest measured fidelity
gap in the project: chord-heavy songs where humans chart 50-100% chord
positions and transcription supplies 8-30% (24-song max-chord study).
Demotion is not the thief - SUPPLY is: the mix transcription hears one
voice where the guitar plays two. So where the isolated guitar stem's own
transcription shows a second comparable voice at a tick the chart left as
a single note, the second lane is added - evidence-backed, never invented.

Separation itself lives in chartgen.stems (one pass per song, shared with
lyrics/solos/taps/rescue). Everything degrades gracefully: no SW backend,
or no guitar in the song, means no changes.
