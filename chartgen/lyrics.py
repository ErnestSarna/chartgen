"""Lyric events for Clone Hero: real synced lyrics first, transcription second.

CH renders lyrics from `[Events]` lines: `phrase_start` opens a line at the
top of the highway, `lyric <word>` fills it word by word, `phrase_end` closes
it. Timing comes from the tempo map — lyrics are display text, so they keep
their raw ticks instead of being snapped to the note grid.

Two sources, tried in order:

1. LRCLIB (see lrclib.py). Hand-synced lines, real words, no model. Measured
   on the charts we had generated, it matched every song whose metadata was
   clean, which makes it the primary source rather than a nicety.
2. faster-whisper. The fallback for anything LRCLIB does not carry —
   unreleased tracks, remixes, anything the community has not synced.

Instrumentals need no special-casing: LRCLIB has no entry and the no-speech
filter yields nothing, so the chart is written without an empty lyric line.

The Whisper model (base, ~150MB) downloads from Hugging Face on first use and
is cached. GPU is tried first; any CUDA/cuDNN mismatch falls back to CPU int8,
which transcribes a 4-minute song in a couple of minutes.

# too lax at the fade-out where hallucinations live, and too strict on quiet
# singing (measured 0.658 on a clearly-sung chorus). Against LRCLIB as a
