"""Flow motifs: the pattern layer between "correct" and "feels human".

Measured against the 800-chart genre-balanced library (2026-08-29 motif
study), the biggest kinesthetic gaps in generated charts were:

- sustain stairs (stepped legato holds): 78% of human charts use them,
  median 5.7 per 100 bars in every genre family; ours had ~0. Humans hold
  each note of a slow stepped phrase until ~80ms before the next one.
- structured fast runs: our fast-run density matches humans but the runs
  wander (shapeless zigzags) where humans chunk them into 3-4 note
  monotonic wraps (rolls) - the RBN wrapping doctrine.
- machine-gun spam: same-lane 16th runs in 77% of our charts vs a human
  31% (median 0 per 100 bars) - pitch-collapse artifacts, not chugs.
- stray pushes: 2.4x the human share of off-8th 16ths, because jitter
  reads as syncopation. Human pushes RECUR at the same bar position.
- forced HOPOs: 86% of human charts force, median 3.9 flags per 100
  notes, mostly turning on-beat stepwise 8ths into legato runs.
- chord ladders: a minority accent (42% of charts) with one canonical
  template - RBN's walk where one finger moves at a time
  (BO YO YB RB RY GY GR), pickups charted as the next chord's root.

Everything here runs on chart notes only - no audio - so it applies to
both engines. Transforms are deterministic and note-count-preserving
except where the doctrine is explicitly reductive (machine-gun thinning,
stray-push settling), mirroring texture.consolidate_gallops: a repeated
figure is the rhythm, a one-off consolidates.
