"""Simulate a human playing the chart, and flag what cannot be played.

Every other quality gate here measures STATISTICS — density, chord share,
fret spread — and a chart can satisfy all of them and still contain a passage
no hand can execute. This models the hands instead: between two positions a
player has to move/re-shape the fretting hand and (unless the note hammers on)
strum. Each of those costs time, and the chart hands you a fixed amount.

The costs below are calibrated so that real human charts come out almost
entirely feasible — the point of reference is what charters actually ask of
players, not a theory of finger speed.

    the beat/eighth grid, is it dropped: an off-grid note is ornament, while
