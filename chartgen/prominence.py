"""Followed-instrument timeline: which stem a charter would follow, per
4-bar window (the Route B prominence prior).

Why a model and not a rule: the 95-song ownership study measured stem
ENERGY and found it predicts nothing about which line humans chart, and
the 299-song Route B dump (2026-09-05) confirmed it - the loudest stem by
energy names the followed instrument in 32% of contested windows, by
K-weighted loudness 35%. But a small gradient-boosting model on the same
level shares reaches 81%, and 91% once per-stem onset density joins in
(92.4% over all labeled windows, song-level 5-fold, precision 96% while
committing on 90% of windows). Labels came from onset matching between
each SW stem's transcription and the human chart, per-song offset
corrected, coincidence split (tools/prominence_pilot.py); the model is
trained by tools/prominence_train.py --save and stored next to this file.

Runtime cost on top of the SW separation every song already pays: four
extra stem transcriptions (~7 s each on CPU; the guitar stem's is reused
when the chord-texture pass already made it) and the features below.

Consumers read the timeline as merged RUNS of consecutive same-stem
windows: taps decide per run, note selection may commit per run. The
window is a 4-bar unit on the chart's own beat grid, the granularity the
charters' switches happen at; single-window blips between two agreeing
neighbours are smoothed away first.

# the FOLLOWED stem alone, through the same admission rules (amplitude
# and pitch floors, octave lift, empty-tick-only dedupe). Rhythm rescue
# stays the second pass for synth/bass drops where pitch fails outright.
