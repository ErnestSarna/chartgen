Generation is sampled, and lane choice turned out to be the least stable thing
about it: four runs at identical settings on one clip produced 84% red, an even
spread, and 34% open notes. The mapping is fine and the model does use all five
frets, but nothing downstream noticed when a run collapsed onto one lane.

So score a candidate and regenerate if it is bad, rather than trusting one roll.
