"""Find the guitar solo by listening for one, not by waiting for a lyric gap.

The old rule marked any chroma section with no transcribed words that played
busier than average. Measured against 141 human charts, every assumption in
it is wrong:

- only 30% of songs carry a solo at all, so marking one is the exception;
- a lyric-free gap of two bars or more contains a solo 18% of the time —
  intros, bridges, breakdowns and outros all look identical under "nobody is
  singing";
- solos are not reliably busier. Median density is 1.20x the song average but
  the lower quartile is 0.89x, so a >=1.2x gate throws away half of them;
- they are long: median 64 beats, about 16 bars.

A sweep over 508 lyric-free gaps found no combination of chart-only features
above ~20% precision, which settles where the missing signal has to come
from. Pati & Lerch (AES 2017, "A Dataset and Method for Electric Guitar Solo
Detection in Rock Music") define a solo as a lead voice in the FOREGROUND,
playing phrases that DO NOT REPEAT, for longer than two measures — and their
classifier reaches 63% precision from three feature groups: spectral
baseline, predominant pitch with its confidence, and structural repetition.

That is the shape copied here, minus the SVM (no training data) and minus
Melodia (Essentia ships no Windows wheels). librosa's pyin gives the pitch
track and its voiced probability; the chroma sections the pipeline already
computes give the repetition feature. Since even a purpose-built classifier
tops out near 63% precision, this is deliberately biased toward silence: a
section has to look like a solo on several independent counts before it is
marked, and songs with nothing convincing get no marker at all — which is
what 70% of human charts do anyway.
