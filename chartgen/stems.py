"""Source separation shared by lyrics, solos, taps, rescue and guitar texture.

Two backends behind one contract. Callers always receive mono float32 at
`SR` under the four Demucs-era names (drums, bass, other, vocals), so no
consumer needs to know which model ran.

- "sw"     BS-RoFormer SW, six stems, THE DEFAULT. Better on every stem we consume
           (vocals 11.3 vs 8.3 SDR, bass 14.6 vs 12.1, drums 14.1 vs 11.2)
           and it adds a real guitar stem (9.05), which is what made
           "is a strummed guitar playing chords here" answerable at all:
           on the local library, guitar songs measure 32-33% guitar-stem
           energy against 0.0% for synth songs, where every chart-level
           signal had measured identical. Runs ~34-48s per song on an
           RTX 3060 Ti via the bs-roformer-infer CLI (MIT code, ~700MB
           weights auto-cached under ~/.cache/bs-roformer-infer).
- "demucs" htdemucs, four stems, ~8s per song. The fallback, and the
           reference the original thresholds were calibrated against.

SW became the DEFAULT on 2026-09-02 after a controlled overnight
recalibration - same songs, same human-chart truth, same sweep code, only
the separator differing - cleared every consumer:
- taps (799 songs, 4733 sections): SW 42%p/44%r vs Demucs 40%p/40%r at
  each backend's optimum, 42/18 vs 41/16 at the production thresholds;
  the tapped-vs-untapped share gap is wider (0.079 vs 0.056) and the
  production rule behaves the same under both, so nothing moved
  underneath calibrated features;
- solos: a wash on the old lead rule (62/11 vs 61/11), but the guitar stem
  SW alone provides gives chartgen.solo a rule at 82% precision held-out
  with ~1 quiet fire per 50 solo-less songs, where the Demucs-era family
  could not pass 2% recall without firing on 14-22 of 100;
- vocals and stem rescue: 0.99 vs 0.96 AUC and 0.28 vs 0.13 precision in
  the 12-song A/B.
Cost: ~37s vs ~8s per song, paid once - the guitar pass no longer
separates a second time.

THE COMPATIBILITY POINT: SW carves guitar and piano OUT of "other", so its
"other" is not the same thing Demucs called "other" - a solo detector
z-scoring "other" energy would silently stop seeing lead guitar. So the
shim rebuilds a Demucs-equivalent residual, other = other+guitar+piano,
and exposes the parts separately as extra keys. Same semantics, better
components; consumers that want the guitar ask for it by name.

Separation failing must never fail a chart - callers treat None as "no
stems, use the old path".
