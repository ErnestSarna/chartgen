"""Reuse note patterns across repeated sections of a song.

Measured on the local library: human charts show a median 55% best-match
pattern overlap between similar-length sections; ours showed 13%. We re-chart
every section from scratch, so a returning chorus arrives with different frets
than the first one — the specific thing that reads as machine-made even when
every note lands on a real onset.

Charters reuse only partially, though: same-named sections overlap 28% at the
median against an 8% control, and 44% of pairs share at least half their notes.
So this does not paste a section wholesale. It keeps the later section's own
RHYTHM — which follows what the audio actually does there — and takes the
earlier section's LANE choices wherever the two line up. Where the sections
genuinely differ, the later one keeps its own material.

    The single strongest machine-tell measured on the 800-chart library:
    the median human chart's most-repeated bar occurs 8x and 48% of its
    bars belong to a >=3x-repeated pattern; ours repeated nothing, ever
    (97 bars, 97 patterns on a song whose human chart strums one riff
    bar 12 times). Players learn a riff physically; a chart that never
    repeats can't be learned, only read.

    Validated against a 19-song calibration sample (2026-08-29): pairwise
    leader-stamping topped out at 39% agreement with the human chart even
    at brutal audio thresholds, because it propagates the leader bar's own
    transcription noise. What works is what charters do - ONE canonical
    pattern per riff: cluster bars by sound alone (chroma AND onset-shape
    cosine against the earliest cluster leader, so clusters cannot drift),
    then majority-vote the pattern across the cluster. On human charts the
    consensus matches the charter's bars at 0.90 median similarity; on
    generated charts it lifts repeated-bar coverage from 0% to ~15-44% per
    song, all of it audio-evidenced denoising.

    Guards, each earning its place in validation:
    - clusters under min_cluster members are not riffs and stay untouched;
    - a cluster whose members do not already agree (mean similarity to
      consensus below min_cluster_sim) is incoherent - skipped whole. The
      0.25 default is deliberately below the 0.40 first guess: freshly
      generated charts carry more cross-repeat transcription noise than
      the library charts the gate was first tuned on (live clusters
      measured 0.27-0.34 mean), and the member guard below is what
      actually protects deliberate variation. At 0.25, human-chart churn
      stays at 5% median / 10% p90 on the calibration sample;
    - a member bar below min_member_sim to the consensus is a fill or a
      variation, exactly what human charters keep distinct - left alone;
    - empty bars stay empty (matching audio is not a licence to invent
      notes where generation heard none), and stamped sustains are
      clamped so they can never overlap whatever follows the bar.
