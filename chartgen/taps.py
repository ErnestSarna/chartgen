"""Mark soft passages as tap notes. Experimental, off by default.

No charting standard documents when to tap (YARG: "use them sensibly", and
nothing else anywhere), and measurement settled that the community has no
rule at all: on 232 genre-balanced charts (76k tapped positions, 34% base
rate) the best acoustic predictor of human taps reaches 39-42% precision -
barely above chance. Human taps are charter style, not acoustics. So this
implements a chosen philosophy rather than a mimicked one: taps mark SOFT
sounds - the piano lines, plucks and gentle synth runs where a strum is
the wrong physical gesture.

Because it is a philosophy and not a measured consensus, the feature ships
off by default; the constants are still swept against the human tap
positions (tools/sweep_taps.py) so "soft" means something calibrated
rather than guessed.

Taps are applied to PHRASES, never lone notes: a single tapped note in a
strummed line is imperceptible at best and confusing at worst, and human
taps arrive in runs. In .chart a tap is `N 6 0` at the note's tick; in CH
it plays without strumming and overrides HOPO state.
