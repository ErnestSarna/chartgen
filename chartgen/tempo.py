"""Beat/tempo detection and musical time->tick conversion.

Why this exists: audio2chart writes every chart at a fixed 200 BPM and places
notes at whatever tick the raw onset time happens to land on. Measured on a test
clip, 2 of 180 notes fell on a beat. Difficulty reducers decide what to keep by
asking "is this note on a beat?", so with an off-grid chart that logic never
fires and Easy/Medium collapse into the same track. Everything here exists to
put notes on a real musical grid so that stays meaningful.
