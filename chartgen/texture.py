"""Chord texture, rhythm consolidation, and climax accents.

Measured on 916 human charts (tools/study_chords.py), the fun gap in
generated charts is not chord COUNT (ours is in-band) but chord TEXTURE:

- humans repeat the SAME chord shape on 59.7% of adjacent chord pairs
  (a strummed riff); ours repeated 17%, because transcription jitter
  flickers the shape and every flicker then read as a "rapid chord
  change" and got demoted to its root. Smoothing flicker into honest
  repeats is what unlocks riffs - same-shape repeats cost the hand
  nothing and were never the playability problem;
- 29-33% of our chords spanned 3+ lanes against a human 5.4%. RBN named
  this failure in 2009 and prescribed the fix: narrow the wide chord
  inward (Orange to Blue), don't delete it;
- our gallop-shaped figures are structurally sound (more grid-aligned
  than humans') but 4.5x too frequent, because the density gate keeps
  every 16th fragment the audio supports while human charters follow
  the RBN reduction doctrine: find the intended rhythm. A real gallop
  REPEATS; a one-off fragment consolidates to even eighths.

Everything here runs on chart notes only - no audio - so it applies to
both engines.
