"""Paired per-song significance testing for calibration decisions.

STRUM's ablation found that 4 of its 7 hand-tuned heuristics had NO
statistically significant effect (|dF1| <= 0.001, p >= 0.29) despite each
having been justified by real failure cases during development — aggregate
deltas hide that a change helps three songs, hurts three others, and does
nothing elsewhere. The remedy is the test they used: Wilcoxon signed-rank
over per-song paired scores.

This provides the helper every future sweep should call before a constant
changes, and demonstrates it on a live question: do the tap softness axes
(attack-led vs brightness-led) actually differ, per song, on the 232-chart
calibration cache?
