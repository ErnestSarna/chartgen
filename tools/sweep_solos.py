"""Choose the solo rule by search over cached evidence, not by intuition.

The first audio-based attempt scored 20% precision / 25% recall - no better
than the lyric-gap rule it replaced - because every test was "above this
song's median", which roughly half of all sections pass by construction.
This searches the actual threshold space against human solo markers.

Scored with F0.5, weighting precision over recall on purpose: a missing solo
marker costs a scoring bonus, while one over a verse reads as plainly wrong.
