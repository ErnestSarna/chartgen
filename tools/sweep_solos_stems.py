"""Re-sweep the solo rule with Demucs stem evidence joined in.

The full-mix rule plateaued at ~75% precision / ~5% recall, and the
missed solos were invisible to full-mix features by any threshold. Stems
add the two signals that were missing:

- singing: true share of the section where the vocal stem is active
  (replaces lyric-word counting, which calibration could never exercise
  because human charts rarely embed lyrics);
- lead: the "other" stem's energy as a per-song z-score - the lead
  instrument surging even when the full mix stays flat.

The position gate is deliberately re-opened in this sweep: it existed
because full-mix features could not tell an intro riff from a solo, and
Mary Jane's Last Dance - whose human chart marks solos at ~31% and ~85%
of the song - is the named acceptance case.
